## JDM Context

- Direct action over explanations
- AI runs commands (JDM does not run terminal manually)
- "TCO" = confirmation, "LFG" = excited
- Standards: `_RPI_STANDARDS/`
- MCP Tools: `MCP-Hub/`
```

### Things JDM Cares About
1. **Speed** - Get things done, don't over-explain
2. **Quality** - Do it right the first time
3. **Documentation** - Capture learnings for future
4. **Scale** - Everything should work at 500K clients

### Things To Avoid
- ❌ Lengthy explanations before action
- ❌ Asking JDM to run terminal commands
- ❌ Creating one-off solutions (think scale)
- ❌ Copying standards into projects (reference them)

## Background (For Context)

### Professional Journey
Josh built RPI after experiencing business failure and near-bankruptcy. This informed his systematic approach - building infrastructure before scaling, documenting everything, and not relying on individual heroics.

### Core Belief
> "You cannot serve 500,000 clients by hiring 500,000 people. We need a way to make each person dramatically more effective."

This is why MDJ exists - it's the only way to hit the 2029 vision.
