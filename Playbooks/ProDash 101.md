# RPI Data Excellence Guide

# **🌟 RPI Data Excellence Guide \- The Foundation of Our Success**

## **🎯 Why Data Excellence Matters to YOU**

Welcome to the most important guide you'll read at RPI\! Whether you're in sales, service, or support, the quality of our data directly impacts your success and our clients' experience.

**The Reality:** We are a data company that happens to sell financial services. Without accurate, complete data, we can't serve clients effectively or identify opportunities that change lives.

**Your Impact:** Every piece of data you touch today affects:

* 💰 Commission opportunities for months to come  
* 📞 Our ability to reach clients when they need us  
* 🎯 Marketing effectiveness and client satisfaction  
* 🏆 Your personal success and the team's success

---

## **🔍 The Universal Data Excellence Principles**

### **Principle 1: Carrier Data is GOLD 🏆**

**Why?** Insurance carriers have entire departments dedicated to maintaining accurate data. When clients move or change numbers, they update their carrier first.

**What This Means for You:**

* Always trust carrier data over existing records  
* Update our systems immediately when you see discrepancies  
* Question outdated information in our database

### **Principle 2: Every Contact is an Opportunity 💎**

**The Mindset Shift:** You're not doing data entry \- you're treasure hunting\!

**What to Watch For:**

* Spouses not in our system  
* Adult children at addresses  
* Outdated products needing review  
* Missing contact information

**Real Example:** *"Updating John Smith's record, noticed his wife Angela (age 66\) at same address but not in our system. Created new contact and opportunity \- potential $2,000 annual commission discovered in 30 seconds\!"*

### **Principle 3: Complete Beats Fast Every Time ⏱️**

**The Truth:** Taking 5 extra minutes to complete a record properly saves hours of future work and prevents lost opportunities.

**Quality Checklist:**

* ✅ Verify phone type (mobile vs. landline)  
* ✅ Confirm email validity  
* ✅ Check for household members  
* ✅ Update all available fields  
* ✅ Delete duplicate/junk entries

---

## **📊 The Four Pillars of Data Excellence**

### **Pillar 1: Contact Information Integrity 📞**

#### **What Great Looks Like:**

* **Phone Numbers:** Type verified (mobile/landline)  
* **Email Addresses:** Tested and valid  
* **Physical Addresses:** Google-verified and complete  
* **Mailing Addresses:** P.O. Boxes noted separately

#### **Your Detective Toolkit:**

* White Pages (verify phone types)  
* Google (validate addresses)  
* Email validators (test addresses)  
* Common sense (does duke@email.com \= preferred name "Duke"?)

### **Pillar 2: Relationship Mapping 👥**

#### **Always Ask Yourself:**

* Who else lives at this address?  
* Is there a spouse/partner?  
* Are there adult children?  
* Who might need our services?

#### **Creating Value:**

Every household member discovered \= potential new client Every relationship mapped \= better service for the family

### **Pillar 3: Product Intelligence 📋**

#### **Beyond the Basics:**

* Don't just note "insurance policy"  
* Specify: "UHC MAPD" or "Mutual MedSup Plan F"  
* Include effective dates  
* Note premium amounts when known  
* Flag policies over 5 years old (opportunity\!)

#### **Why Specifics Matter:**

* Generic: "Has Medicare" ❌  
* Specific: "BCBS MedSup Plan F since 2013" ✅  
* Impact: Second one immediately shows overpayment opportunity

### **Pillar 4: File Organization Mastery 🗂️**

#### **The ACF (Active Client File) System:**

1. **One Source of Truth:** Everything about a client in ONE place  
2. **Consistent Naming:** "John Smith" or "John Smith \+ Jane Smith"  
3. **Logical Structure:** Documents where people expect them  
4. **Regular Cleanup:** Delete duplicates, consolidate files

## **🚀 Your Daily Data Excellence Habits**

When you have more time:

# ProDash/ Contacts

# **🤝 RPI New Client Setup Guide \- Making Every Client Feel Like Family**

## **🎯 What This Guide Covers**

**Time needed:** 10-15 minutes per client  
 **Skill level:** Beginner friendly\!

---

## **📋 Before You Begin \- Your Client Setup Checklist**

Gather as much of this info as possible (don't worry if you don't have it all yet\!):

* \[ \] Full names (including preferred nicknames)  
* \[ \] Contact information (phone, email, address)  
* \[ \] Birthdates  
* \[ \] Marital status

2. **Click "Contacts"** in the main menu  
3. **Hit the big green \+ button** \- let's create some magic\!

Start with what you know \- you can always add more later:

#### **📝 Essential Information:**

* **First Name** & **Last Name** (required)  
* **Preferred Name** \- Maybe John goes by "Jack"? This appears on all their communications\!  
* **Email** \- Their primary contact email  
* **Phone** \- Don't forget to select the type (mobile/home/work)

#### **🕐 Time Zone Settings (Super Important\!)**

Pick the right one so meetings happen when they should:

* **Central**: GMT-05:00 US Central CDT (Chicago time)  
* **Mountain**: GMT-06:00 US Mountain MDT (Denver time)  
* **Pacific**: GMT-07:00 US Los Angeles PDT (LA time)

### **Step 3: Getting to Know Them Better**

#### **👤 Personal Details:**

* **Date of Birth** \- That date picker is your friend\!  
* **Social Security Number** \- If available  
* **Height/Weight** \- Needed for life insurance  
* **Tobacco Usage** \- Including marijuana (some carriers care, some don't)

💡 **Pro Tip**: The birthday picker looks complex but it's actually super fast \- just click year first, then month, then day\!

---

## **🏢 Phase 2: The RPI Relationship \- Getting Official**

This section defines how this client relates to our business:

### **Client Status \- Where They Are in Their Journey**

* **🟢 Active Internal** \- They're our client\!  
* **🤝 Affiliate** \- Client of one of our partners  
* **🔍 Prospect** \- We're courting them  
* **🚫 Fired** \- Redirected to carrier (we track but don't contact)  
* **🕊️ Deceased** \- Important for beneficiary work  
* **⚠️ Complaint** \- Temporary "Do Not Disturb" status

### **Book of Business \- Their Product Home**

Select where they fit in our product lines \- this helps route them to the right specialist\!

### **🗂️ The Magic Green Plus Button\!**

Under "Active Client File Location":

1. **Leave it blank** initially  
2. **Click the green \+ button**  
3. **Watch the magic happen** \- ProDash creates their entire Google Drive folder structure\!  
4. **Hit refresh** \- Boom\! Direct link to their folder appears

---

## **🏠 Phase 3: Address Information \- Where to Find Them**

### **The Google Address Magic ✨**

1. **Start typing** their street address  
2. **Google autocompletes** everything \- city, state, zip\!  
3. **Select "Mailing address same"** if it applies  
4. Watch the system work its magic

💡 **Coming Soon**: When you click "Mailing address same as above" it'll auto-copy everything (we're working on it\!)

---

## **👥 Phase 4: Adding Spouses & Partners \- Better Together\!**

Got a couple? Here's the time-saving way to add their partner:

### **The Amazing Copy Button Method:**

   * First name  
   * Gender  
   * Birth date  
   * Last name (if different)  
4. **Save** \- you've just saved 5 minutes\!

### **📁 Don't Forget to Rename the Folder\!**

1. **Click** their Active Client File link  
2. **Click the dropdown arrow** next to the folder name  
3. **Select "Rename"**  
4. Use these formats:  
   * Married: "John Smith \+ Jane Smith"  
   * Partners: "John Smith \+ Mary Johnson"  
   * With deceased spouse: "John Smith (Jane Smith Deceased)"  
   * With adult children: "John Smith \+ Sarah Smith"

---

## **📂 Phase 5: Organizing Their Digital Life**

### **Understanding the Folder Structure**

Each client folder is like a filing cabinet with these drawers:

```
📁 Client Name Folder
  └── 📁 Opportunities (Active cases)
      └── 📁 Cases
          └── 📁 Active/Inactive
              └── 📁 Medicare/Retirement
  └── 📁 Accounts (What they own)
      └── 📁 Active/Inactive
          └── 📁 Product Categories
  └── 📁 New Business (Sales in progress)
  └── 📁 Service (Ongoing service needs)
```

### **Where to Put Client Documents:**

* **Statements** → Drag into appropriate Accounts folder  
* **Applications** → New Business folder  
* **Service requests** → Service folder  
* **Illustrations** → Opportunities folder

### **🔍 Pro Navigation Tips:**

* **Lost?** Use the search bar with their name  
* **Recent files** show in the sidebar  
* **Breadcrumbs** at the bottom show where you are  
* **Split screen** to drag documents while viewing ProDash

---

## **💪 Best Practices for Client Success**

### **🎯 Data Quality Matters\!**

Remember: "Garbage in, garbage out" \- take the extra second to:

* ✅ Double-check spelling of names  
* ✅ Verify email addresses  
* ✅ Confirm phone numbers  
* ✅ Select correct time zones

### **💾 Save Early, Save Often\!**

ProDash doesn't auto-save (yet), so:

* Hit that save button after each section  
* Especially before clicking away  
* If your power blinks, you'll thank yourself\!

### **📝 Documentation Is Love**

When you figure out something new:

1. **Write it down** while it's fresh  
2. **Share with the team** in Slack  
3. **Update this guide** if needed  
4. **Pay it forward** to the next person\!

---

## **🆘 Troubleshooting \- When Things Get Quirky**

### **Common Hiccups and Fixes:**

**"The folders won't minimize\!"**

* We're working on a "minimize all" button  
* For now, click each arrow manually  
* It's annoying, we know\!

**"I can't see the file path\!"**

* Look at the very bottom of the Google Drive window  
* It's in light gray text (easy to miss\!)  
* Shows when you hover over files

**"The address didn't auto-populate\!"**

* Try typing just the house number and street  
* Select from the dropdown that appears  
* If still stuck, enter manually and report in \#jmd-fixes

**"I accidentally closed without saving\!"**

* Take a deep breath  
* You'll need to re-enter the data  
* We've all been there\!  
* Feature request for auto-save is submitted
