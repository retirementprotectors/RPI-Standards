# Staffing Model/Sales/Service

The Staffing Model:

The entire staffing model is built upon the output of one highly productive coordinator. This is the "biggest lever" in the system.  
• **The Catalyst:** **1 Coordinator** making 500 manual calls per week is expected to book **200 appointments**.  
• **The Ripple Effect:** These 200 appointments create the need for a full support team:  
    ◦ **13 Junior Specialists** (to run the 200 initial discovery meetings).  
    ◦ **6 Senior Specialists** (to run closing appointments).  
    ◦ **2 Junior Associates** and **4 Senior Associates** (to build the 100 cases generated from the meetings).  
    ◦ **2 New Business Service People** (to process the \~240 closed deals per month).

## **Executive Summary & Strategic Action Plan**

**📍 The Lodge | October 2025 | 5-Year Anniversary Meeting**

[***ZOOM MEETING VIDEO***](https://zoom.us/rec/share/lmCKPnfNqmr2IGruJ38mr8CmoEWMo2hjMTOhcP7ui1yWY4ClwAQem7qegP3t2mZ5.6t_IrWdkS3iULZBw) \[ j%G3HNP4\]

## **🎯 Meeting Context & Significance**

### **The 5-Year Circle**

Josh Millang opened this meeting at the exact location where, on October 1st, 2020, he received what he called a "death sentence" email. Managing two businesses on opposite coasts, he was drowning when—as he quoted Jim Gaffigan—instead of being thrown a life vest, he was thrown "an anvil."

*"It's amazing that we're at the exact same point that we were before... completely different players... rebuilding the B2B model."*

**The Lodge:** Premier facility with 60-person training capacity, 4 bedrooms, multiple common areas. Located 10 minutes from Murfreesboro (Nashville suburb). Targeted as annual retreat location.

## **💡 The Vision: Building "The Machine"**

**From Individual Heroics to Systematic Excellence**

Creating a business that runs on documented, scalable processes rather than depending on individual efforts. Every role duplicatable, every process measurable, every outcome predictable.

*"When we have enough data that we know what the numbers should be for everything... if it's less than 15 days, something's wrong. We need to tighten something up."*

**Current Challenge:** Building roles while developing people simultaneously

* Tools, processes, and structures being created in real-time  
* Example: Retirement Sales Associate role is "an incomplete idea"  
* Balance of building the plane while flying it

**End Goal:** Transform RPI into a true operating system where success is engineered, not hoped for. A duplicatable, scalable model that can grow beyond any individual contributor.
