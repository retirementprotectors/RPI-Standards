# What Josh Is Building (And Why It Matters To You)
## A Plain-English Explanation for Team RPI

---

## The Short Version

Josh is building an AI system called **MDJ (MyDigitalJosh)** that will give every person on this team access to his 20+ years of expertise—instantly, anytime, without waiting for him to be available.

**Think of it like this:** Instead of having one Josh who can only be in one place at a time, every team member gets their own "digital Josh" that knows what Josh knows and can help them do their job better.

## Why This Matters

### The Problem We Have Today

- Josh has knowledge in his head that took 20 years to build
- When you need that knowledge, you have to wait for Josh
- Josh can only talk to one person at a time
- As we grow, this bottleneck gets worse

### The Problem We'll Have Tomorrow

Our goals for the next few years:

| When | Clients |
|------|---------|
| Today | ~6,000 |
| End of 2026 | 25,000-30,000 |
| End of 2029 | 500,000 |

**You cannot serve 500,000 clients by hiring 500,000 people.** We need a way to make each person on this team dramatically more effective.

## What MDJ Actually Is

MDJ is an AI assistant customized for your specific role. It's not a generic chatbot—it knows RPI's business, our clients, our processes, and Josh's way of thinking about problems.

### What You'll Be Able to Do

**Service Team (Susan, Christa, Nikki):**
> "Mrs. Johnson called—her doctor retired. What do I need to know?"

MDJ will instantly pull up:
- Her full client history
- Her current plan details
- Whether the new doctor is in her network
- What actions to take
- What Josh would tell you to watch out for

**Sales Team (Lucas, Lacy, Archer, Alex, Shane):**
> "I have a meeting with a T65 in Des Moines who takes Eliquis and sees Dr. Martinez. What should I lead with?"

MDJ will instantly give you:
- Dr. Martinez's network status across all plans
- Drug coverage comparison for Eliquis
- Recommended plans for that situation
- Josh's playbook notes for that type of client

**Leadership (John, Division Leaders):**
> "Where are we vs. our 2026 targets?"

MDJ will show:
- Real-time progress across all metrics
- Which areas are on pace, which are behind
- What's causing any gaps
- What Josh would focus on

## What This Means For Your Job

### What DOESN'T Change
- You still make the decisions
- You still build the relationships
- You still do the work
- Your expertise still matters

### What DOES Change
- You spend less time hunting for information
- You get Josh-level guidance without waiting for Josh
- You can handle more clients at the same quality level
- New team members ramp up faster (they have MDJ from day one)

## The Bigger Picture

Josh isn't building this because he's obsessed with AI. He's building it because:

1. **It's the only way to hit our goals.** 500,000 clients with traditional staffing would require 1,000+ employees. That's not realistic or desirable.

2. **It protects what we've built.** All the knowledge in people's heads can walk out the door. MDJ captures it permanently.

3. **It makes your job better.** Less searching, less waiting, more doing.

4. **It's our competitive advantage.** Other companies can copy our marketing or our processes. They can't copy 20 years of encoded expertise.

## When Will This Happen?

| Phase | When | What You'll See |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Foundation | Now - Q1 2026 | Josh building the underlying systems |
| First MDJ | Q2 2026 | Service and Medicare sales teams get MDJ |
| Full Rollout | Q3-Q4 2026 | All teams have MDJ access |
| Scale | 2027+ | MDJ gets smarter as we use it |

---

## What You Can Do Now

1. **Keep doing your job well.** The expertise you're building is exactly what MDJ will learn from.

2. **Document what you know.** When you figure something out, write it down. That knowledge feeds the system.

3. **Don't worry about being replaced.** MDJ makes you more valuable, not less. A person with MDJ can do what 5 people without it can do.

4. **Ask questions.** If something about this doesn't make sense, ask Josh or John.

## The Bottom Line

Josh said on Friday: *"You ain't gonna feel underutilized anymore."*

MDJ is how that happens. It's not about working harder—it's about having superpowers.

Every one of you was hired because you're good at what you do. MDJ just removes the friction that slows you down.

*Questions? Talk to Josh or John. This is happening, and you're part of it.*
