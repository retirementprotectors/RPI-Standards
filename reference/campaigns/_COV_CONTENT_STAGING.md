## COV-PREAEP — Medicare Pre-AEP
**Trigger**: Jul-Sep. Client has wealth/legacy products with RPI but NOT Medicare.
**Division**: HEALTH

### Subject Line
AEP Is Coming — And Medicare Is One of the Biggest Things We Do

### Introduction
{FirstName}, the Medicare Annual Enrollment Period starts in October, and before the flood of mailers and phone calls hits, we wanted to reach out. You've got your {Carrier} {ProductName} with us, and we've been taking care of that for you — but we don't currently have your Medicare coverage on file. Medicare is a full third of our practice, and with AEP approaching, this is the perfect time to see if we can bring the same level of attention to your health insurance.

### Value Prop
Here's what we do for our Medicare clients that nobody else will: we pull your prescriptions, providers, pharmacies, and healthcare data, and we run a full cost projection against every plan available in your area. We don't just pick a plan — we build a data-driven comparison that shows you exactly what each option costs based on how YOU actually use healthcare. Then we monitor your plan year-round and proactively review it every AEP to make sure you're always on the best option. It's the same level of service we give your other accounts — applied to your health insurance.

### Pain Point
If your Medicare coverage isn't being actively managed, there's a good chance you're leaving value on the table. Plans change every year — networks shift, formularies update, costs adjust — and without someone running the numbers on your behalf, it's easy to end up on a plan that doesn't fit your situation anymore. AEP is the window to make changes, and it's coming up fast. This is exactly what we're built for.

### VM Script
Hey {FirstName}, this is {AgentName} with {BOBName}. AEP is right around the corner and I wanted to reach out because Medicare is a huge part of what we do. You've got your {Carrier} {ProductName} with us but we're not handling your Medicare coverage, and with enrollment opening in October, this is a great time to take a look. Give me a call at {Phone} and we'll see if we can add some value there.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

The Medicare Annual Enrollment Period begins in October, and before the flood of information starts, we wanted to reach out.

You've trusted us with your {Carrier} {ProductName} {ProductType}, and we appreciate that relationship. But we noticed we're not currently managing your Medicare coverage — and Medicare is a full third of our practice.

Here's what our Proactive Service Model for Medicare includes:

- Full analysis of your prescriptions, providers, and pharmacies
- Data-driven cost projections based on your actual healthcare usage
- Side-by-side plan comparisons against every option in your area
- Annual reviews every AEP with year-round monitoring

AEP is the one time each year you can make changes to your Medicare coverage, and it's coming up fast. If your plan hasn't been proactively reviewed, there's a good chance you're leaving value on the table.

Let's connect before enrollment opens and see if we can bring the same level of service to your health insurance that we bring to everything else.

## COV-LTC — LTC Awareness
**Trigger**: November (LTC Awareness Month). Client doesn't have long-term care coverage with RPI.
**Division**: LEGACY

### Subject Line
Do You Have a Plan for Long-Term Care?

### Introduction
{FirstName}, November is Long-Term Care Awareness Month, and it's something we talk to our clients about because it's one of the biggest financial risks most people aren't planning for. You've got your {Carrier} {ProductName} with us, and we're taking care of that — but when it comes to long-term care, most people assume Medicare or their health insurance will cover it. It won't.

### Value Prop
Here's the reality: Medicare covers very limited skilled nursing — typically up to 100 days under specific conditions — and it does not cover custodial care, which is the type of care most people actually need (help with daily activities, assisted living, home health aides). The average cost of a private room in a nursing facility is over $100,000 per year, and a home health aide can run $60,000+. There are products designed specifically to address this — from standalone long-term care policies to hybrid life insurance policies with LTC riders — and the right option depends on your situation, your age, your health, and your goals. That's what we help you figure out.

### Pain Point
The biggest risk with long-term care isn't the care itself — it's the financial impact on you and your family if you don't have a plan. A long-term care event can burn through a lifetime of savings in a matter of years. The earlier you address it, the more options you have and the more affordable they are. Waiting until you need care to think about how to pay for it is the most expensive option of all.

Most people assume Medicare covers it, but it really doesn't. There are some great options out there depending on your situation, and it's worth a conversation. Give me a call at {Phone}.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

November is Long-Term Care Awareness Month, and we wanted to make sure this is on your radar.

Here's what most people don't realize:

- Medicare covers very limited skilled nursing (up to 100 days under specific conditions)
- Medicare does NOT cover custodial care — help with daily activities, assisted living, home health aides
- The average cost of a private nursing facility room exceeds $100,000 per year
- A long-term care event can exhaust a lifetime of savings in just a few years

There are products designed specifically to address this risk — standalone long-term care policies, hybrid life insurance with LTC riders, and annuity-based solutions with care benefits. The right option depends on your age, health, goals, and financial situation.

You've trusted us with your {Carrier} {ProductName} {ProductType}. Long-term care planning is another core area of what we do, and the earlier you address it, the more options you have and the more affordable they are.

## COV-LIAM — Life Insurance Awareness
**Trigger**: September (Life Insurance Awareness Month). Client doesn't have life insurance with RPI.
**Division**: LEGACY

### Subject Line
Is Your Life Insurance Where It Should Be?

### Introduction
{FirstName}, September is Life Insurance Awareness Month, and we wanted to check in. You've got your {Carrier} {ProductName} with us, and we appreciate that trust — but life insurance is another core part of what we do, and we want to make sure you're covered the way you should be. Whether you have a policy somewhere else that hasn't been reviewed in years, or you don't have coverage at all, this is worth a conversation.

### Value Prop
Life insurance isn't a set-it-and-forget-it product. If you have a policy, is it performing the way it should? Is the coverage amount still right for your situation? Are the costs of insurance eating into your cash value faster than the interest is building it? If you don't have a policy, the options available today — indexed universal life, whole life, term — are worth understanding, because the right product depends entirely on what you're trying to accomplish. We can review what you have, run an in-force illustration if you have an existing policy, and show you where you stand.

### Pain Point
The most common thing we see: people who bought a life insurance policy 10 or 20 years ago and haven't looked at it since. Costs of insurance go up as you age. If interest rates or index credits haven't kept pace, your policy could be quietly falling behind. The worst time to find that out is when it's too late to fix. A review now tells you whether your policy is going to last as long as you are — and if it's not, what to do about it.

### Email CTA
Life insurance is a core part of what we do. Let's connect and make sure you're in good shape.

Dear {FirstName},

September is Life Insurance Awareness Month, and we wanted to make sure your coverage is where it should be.

You've trusted us with your {Carrier} {ProductName} {ProductType}. Life insurance is another core area of our practice, and whether you have a policy that hasn't been reviewed or you don't currently have coverage, we'd like to help.

**If you have an existing policy:**
- Is it performing the way you expected?
- Are costs of insurance outpacing your interest credits?
- Is your coverage amount still right for your situation?
- Will your policy last as long as you are?

We can order an in-force illustration and answer all of those questions.

**If you don't have life insurance:**
The options available today are worth understanding. The right product depends on your goals — income replacement, legacy planning, cash value accumulation, or a combination.

## COV-DI — Disability Insurance
**Trigger**: May (Disability Insurance Awareness Month). For working clients without DI coverage.
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
What Happens to Your Income If You Can't Work?

### Introduction
{FirstName}, May is Disability Insurance Awareness Month, and it's a question worth thinking about: if something happened and you couldn't work for an extended period, what happens to your income? You've got your {Carrier} {ProductName} with us, and we're looking out for you — but income protection is one of the most overlooked areas of financial planning, and it's worth a conversation.

### Value Prop
Most people insure their home, their car, and their health — but not the income that pays for all of it. Disability insurance replaces a portion of your income if an illness or injury keeps you from working. Whether you have coverage through your employer or you don't have it at all, we can review your situation and make sure the gap between what you'd need and what you'd have is covered. The options range from short-term and long-term disability policies to supplemental coverage that stacks on top of what your employer provides.

### Pain Point
The statistics are sobering: roughly 1 in 4 working adults will experience a disability that keeps them out of work for a year or more before they reach retirement. If that happened to you, could your household sustain itself on savings alone? Employer-provided disability — if you have it — typically covers only 60% of your base salary with caps and limitations. The gap between that and your actual expenses is where things get difficult.

### Email CTA
Income protection is one of the biggest gaps we see. Let's make sure you're covered.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

May is Disability Insurance Awareness Month, and we wanted to ask a simple question: if you couldn't work for an extended period due to illness or injury, what happens to your income?

Consider these facts:
- Roughly 1 in 4 working adults will experience a disability before retirement
- Employer disability coverage (if you have it) typically covers only 60% of base salary with caps
- The gap between your employer coverage and your actual expenses can be significant
- Most people insure their home, car, and health — but not the income that pays for all of it

You've trusted us with your {Carrier} {ProductName} {ProductType}. Income protection is another area we can help with — from standalone disability policies to supplemental coverage that fills the gaps in what your employer provides.

## COV-LOVE — Insure Your Love
**Trigger**: February. Valentine's season — protecting the people you love.
**Division**: LEGACY

### Subject Line
This Valentine's Season, Make Sure the People You Love Are Protected

### Introduction
{FirstName}, February is "Insure Your Love" month, and while it might not sound as romantic as flowers and chocolate, it's one of the most meaningful things you can do for the people who matter most to you. You've got your {Carrier} {ProductName} with us — and part of being your people means making sure your family is protected if something unexpected happens.

### Value Prop
Life insurance, legacy planning, and income protection aren't just financial products — they're promises to the people you love that they'll be taken care of no matter what. Whether that means a life insurance policy that ensures your spouse can maintain their lifestyle, a plan that covers your children's education, or making sure your estate passes the way you intend — we can review your situation and identify any gaps. A conversation now takes 15 minutes. The peace of mind lasts a lifetime.

### Pain Point
Nobody likes thinking about what happens if they're not around. But the people who depend on you are counting on you to have a plan. The most common thing we see is families who assumed they were covered, only to find out the coverage was outdated, insufficient, or didn't exist at all. A quick review now makes sure that doesn't happen to yours.

- **Income protection:** If something happened to you, can your family maintain their lifestyle?

## COV-ANN — Annuity Awareness
**Trigger**: June (Annuity Awareness Month). Client doesn't have an annuity with RPI.
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
Is Your Retirement Income Guaranteed?

### Introduction
{FirstName}, June is Annuity Awareness Month, and we wanted to bring something to your attention. You've got your {Carrier} {ProductName} with us, and we're taking care of that — but when it comes to guaranteed retirement income, most people have a gap they don't realize is there. Annuities are a core part of what we do, and it's worth understanding whether one could strengthen your financial picture.

### Value Prop
Here's the fundamental question: do you have enough guaranteed income to cover your essential expenses in retirement — no matter what the market does? Social Security covers a portion, but for most people, it's not enough. An annuity can fill that gap with income you can't outlive. Whether your goal is guaranteed income now, guaranteed income later, principal protection, or access to your capital in the event of a long-term care need, there are products designed for each of those objectives. We can analyze your current income sources, identify the gap, and show you what the options look like.

### Pain Point
The biggest risk in retirement isn't losing money — it's outliving your money. Market downturns, unexpected healthcare costs, inflation — all of these can erode your savings faster than you planned. People who rely solely on market-based investments for retirement income are one bad sequence of returns away from a very different retirement than they planned. Guaranteed income removes that variable from the equation.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

June is Annuity Awareness Month, and we wanted to ask a simple question: is your retirement income guaranteed?

Social Security covers a portion of your expenses, but for most people, it's not enough. The gap between what Social Security provides and what you actually need is where things get uncertain — especially when markets are volatile.

An annuity can fill that gap with income you can't outlive. Depending on your goals, the options include:

- **Guaranteed income now** — Start receiving payments immediately
- **Guaranteed income later** — Lock in future income while your money grows
- **Principal protection** — Protect your savings from market downturns
- **Long-term care access** — Funds available if you need extended care

You've trusted us with your {Carrier} {ProductName} {ProductType}. Retirement income planning is another core area of our practice, and we'd like to show you where you stand.

## COV-TAX — Tax Planner
**Trigger**: Feb-Apr (tax season). Financial review through a tax lens.
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
Tax Season Is Here — Let's Make Sure Your Financial Plan Reflects It

### Introduction
{FirstName}, tax season is a natural time to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. You've got your {Carrier} {ProductName} with us, and we're on top of that — but your financial decisions have tax implications, and tax season is the perfect time to make sure everything is working together the way it should.

### Value Prop
Here's what we can review together: how your current products are positioned from a tax perspective, whether there are opportunities to optimize — things like tax-deferred growth, Roth conversions, required minimum distributions, or leveraging the tax advantages of certain insurance products. We're not CPAs and we're not giving tax advice — but we understand how the products we manage interact with your tax situation, and we can make sure you're not leaving money on the table or getting surprised come April.

### Pain Point
Most people think about taxes once a year when they file. But the decisions you make throughout the year — contributions, distributions, reallocations — all have tax consequences. A quick review now, while taxes are top of mind, can identify opportunities you might be missing and make sure your financial plan and your tax plan are actually aligned.
