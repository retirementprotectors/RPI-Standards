## AGE-50 — Catch-Up Contributions Begin
**Trigger**: Client turns 50 — IRS catch-up contributions unlock ($7,500/yr 401k, $1,000/yr IRA)
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
You Just Unlocked an Extra $7,500 a Year

### Introduction
{FirstName}, now that you've turned 50, the IRS lets you contribute more to your retirement accounts than you could before. It's called a catch-up contribution — and most people don't know it exists.

### Value Prop
Starting at 50, you can put an additional $7,500 per year into your 401(k) and an extra $1,000 per year into your IRA — on top of the standard limits. Over 15 years, that's over $125,000 in additional tax-advantaged savings. Whether you're behind on retirement savings or ahead of schedule, this is an opportunity to accelerate.

### Pain Point
Most people turn 50 and nothing changes with their retirement plan contributions. They keep contributing the same amount they always have — not because they can't afford more, but because nobody told them the rules changed. Every year you don't take advantage of catch-up contributions is a year of tax-advantaged growth you don't get back.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

Happy 50th birthday — and congratulations on reaching a milestone that comes with a financial benefit most people never hear about.

Starting at age 50, the IRS allows you to make catch-up contributions to your retirement accounts. That means an additional $7,500 per year into your 401(k) and an extra $1,000 per year into your IRA — on top of the standard contribution limits.

Over the next 15 years, that's potentially over $125,000 in additional tax-advantaged retirement savings. Whether you're looking to accelerate your savings or simply want to make sure you're maximizing every available option, this is worth a conversation.

We'd like to review your current contribution strategy and make sure you're positioned to take full advantage. No changes required unless they make sense for your situation.

## AGE-55 — Rule of 55 (Penalty-Free 401k Access)
**Trigger**: Client turns 55 — Rule of 55 allows penalty-free 401(k) withdrawal if separated from employer
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
Turning 55 Changed the Rules on Your 401(k)

### Introduction
{FirstName}, now that you've turned 55, there's a provision in the tax code that most people — and even some financial advisors — don't know about. It's called the Rule of 55, and it may give you penalty-free access to your 401(k) earlier than you expected.

### Value Prop
If you've separated from your employer (or are planning to) in the year you turn 55 or later, you can withdraw from that employer's 401(k) without the 10% early withdrawal penalty. This applies specifically to the plan associated with that employer — and it's a window that doesn't exist for IRA rollovers. Understanding when and how to use this rule can be the difference between a flexible transition and an unnecessary tax hit.

### Pain Point
Here's what we see too often: someone leaves their employer at 55 or later, rolls their 401(k) into an IRA — and unknowingly locks themselves out of penalty-free access until 59½. The Rule of 55 only applies to the employer plan you separated from. Once you roll it, the window closes. That's a costly mistake that's completely avoidable with the right conversation at the right time.

### Email CTA
Whether you've already separated or you're thinking about it, we'd like to make sure you understand exactly how the Rule of 55 applies to your situation — and what your options look like. Call us at {Phone} or book a time at {CalendarLink}.

### VM Script
Hi {FirstName}, it's {AgentName} with {BOBName}. I'm reaching out because you've hit 55, and there's a tax rule that just kicked in that could affect how you access your 401(k). It's called the Rule of 55, and it's one of those things most people don't hear about until it's too late. We want to make sure you have the full picture. Give me a call at {Phone} whenever you get a chance.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

Turning 55 is a milestone that comes with a financial provision most people never learn about — or learn about too late.

It's called the Rule of 55. If you separate from your employer in the year you turn 55 or later, you can access your 401(k) with that employer without the standard 10% early withdrawal penalty. This applies only to the plan associated with the employer you separated from — not to IRAs or plans from previous employers.

Here's why this matters: we see clients roll their 401(k) into an IRA before they understand this rule, and in doing so, they unknowingly give up penalty-free access until age 59½. That's a 4½-year gap that could have been avoided with the right information at the right time.

Whether you've already left your employer, you're planning a transition, or you just want to understand your options — we'd like to walk you through how this applies to your specific situation.

## AGE-59 — 59½ Penalty-Free IRA Access
**Trigger**: Client reaches 59½ — 10% early withdrawal penalty eliminated on all retirement accounts
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
Your Retirement Accounts Just Became Fully Accessible

### Introduction
{FirstName}, now that you've reached 59½, the 10% early withdrawal penalty on your IRA distributions is officially behind you. Your money is accessible without penalty — and that changes your planning options significantly.

### Value Prop
At 59½, every dollar in your traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and most employer-sponsored plans is accessible to you without the 10% IRS penalty. This doesn't mean you should start pulling money out — but it means you now have complete flexibility to reposition, consolidate, or access funds if your situation calls for it. If you're still working, in-service withdrawals from your employer plan may also be available. This is a planning milestone worth a conversation.

### Pain Point
The risk at 59½ isn't that you'll take money out too early — the penalty is gone. The risk is that nothing changes in your strategy. Your accounts may be scattered across multiple custodians from different jobs, sitting in allocations you set years ago. Without a review at this milestone, you could be carrying unnecessary complexity or leaving optimization opportunities on the table for the next 10+ years.

### Email CTA
We'd like to do a full review of your retirement accounts now that the penalty window has passed. Let's make sure everything is consolidated, optimized, and aligned with where you're headed. Call us at {Phone} or book a time at {CalendarLink}.

Hi {FirstName}, it's {AgentName} with {BOBName}. You've reached 59½, which means the early withdrawal penalty on your retirement accounts is officially gone.

Give me a call at {Phone} whenever you get a chance.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

Reaching age 59½ is a quiet milestone — but a significant one. The 10% early withdrawal penalty that has applied to your retirement account distributions is now behind you.

This doesn't mean it's time to start taking money out. But it does mean your options have expanded. You now have full flexibility to:

- Consolidate accounts from previous employers into a single, optimized strategy
- Reposition funds if your goals or risk tolerance have changed
- Access money if your situation calls for it — without penalty
- Explore in-service withdrawal options if you're still with your current employer

Many clients reach this point with retirement accounts scattered across multiple custodians, sitting in allocations that haven't been reviewed in years. This is the ideal time to bring everything together and make sure your money is working as efficiently as possible for the years ahead.

We'd like to sit down and do a comprehensive review. No changes unless they make sense for you.

## AGE-62 — First Social Security Claim Year
**Trigger**: Client turns 62 — first eligible to file for Social Security (permanently reduced benefit)
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
You Can File for Social Security Now — Here's What to Consider

### Introduction
{FirstName}, you've reached 62 — which means you're now eligible to file for Social Security for the first time. This is one of the most consequential financial decisions you'll make, and the difference between filing now versus waiting can be hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime.

### Value Prop
At 62, you have options. You can file now and start receiving a reduced benefit — roughly 25-30% less than your Full Retirement Age amount. Or you can wait, and your benefit grows every year until age 70. The right answer depends entirely on your situation: your health, your other income sources, your spouse's benefit, your expenses, and your long-term plan. We run the numbers on all of it so you can make this decision with complete clarity.

### Pain Point
Here's what we see: people file at 62 because they can, not because they should. Or they wait because someone told them to, without running the actual math on their situation. Either way, they're making a permanent decision without a full picture. Social Security is not a one-size-fits-all answer — and once you file, you can't undo it after the first 12 months. The stakes are too high to guess.

### Email CTA
Before you make any decisions about Social Security, let us run a full analysis on your situation. We'll show you exactly what your benefit looks like at 62, at your Full Retirement Age, and at 70 — and how each scenario fits into your overall income plan.

Give me a call at {Phone} whenever you get a chance.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

You've reached age 62, which means you're now eligible to file for Social Security benefits for the first time. This is one of the most important financial decisions you'll make — and it's one you can't easily undo.

Here's what you should know:

Filing at 62 means receiving a permanently reduced benefit — roughly 25-30% less than what you'd receive at your Full Retirement Age. For every year you wait beyond 62, your benefit increases. And if you delay all the way to age 70, your benefit maxes out at 124-132% of your FRA amount.

The difference between claiming at 62 versus 70 can be hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime. But the right answer isn't the same for everyone. It depends on your health, your other income sources, your spouse's situation, your expenses, and your overall retirement plan.

We'd like to run a comprehensive Social Security analysis for you — showing exactly what your benefit looks like at each claiming age and how it fits into your broader financial picture. No pressure to file or to wait. Just complete information so you can make the best decision for your situation.

## AGE-66 — Full Retirement Age (Born 1943-1954)
**Trigger**: Client turns 66 — Full Retirement Age reached, 100% SS benefit available, earnings test eliminated
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
You've Reached Full Retirement Age — Here's What That Means

### Introduction
{FirstName}, congratulations — you've reached your Full Retirement Age. At 66, your Social Security benefit is now available at 100% of what you've earned. No reduction, no penalty for working while collecting. This is a milestone worth understanding fully.

### Value Prop
At your Full Retirement Age, you have the full benefit you've earned — and you have options. You can file now and collect 100% of your benefit. You can continue to delay and earn an additional 8% per year in delayed retirement credits, up to age 70. Or, if you've already filed, the earnings limit that may have reduced your checks is now gone. We can show you exactly what each path looks like with your actual numbers.

### Pain Point
Many clients reach Full Retirement Age without realizing what just changed. If you've been working and deferring, you may not know that the earnings test no longer applies. If you've been waiting to file, you may not realize that each additional year of delay adds 8% to your benefit — but only until 70. And if your spouse is also approaching FRA, the coordination between your two benefits is a conversation worth having before either of you files.

### Email CTA
Let's sit down and look at where you stand now that you've reached FRA. We'll review your benefit, your spouse's benefit if applicable, and your overall income strategy to make sure everything is aligned. Call us at {Phone} or book a time at {CalendarLink}.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

Congratulations on reaching your Full Retirement Age. At 66, your Social Security benefit is now available at its full, unreduced amount — and several important things have changed.

First, the earnings test no longer applies. If you're still working, your Social Security benefit will no longer be reduced regardless of how much you earn.

Second, if you haven't filed yet, you now have a clear choice: collect your full benefit today, or continue delaying and earn an additional 8% per year in delayed retirement credits up to age 70. That's a guaranteed 32% increase over the next four years if you can afford to wait.

Third, if you have a spouse approaching retirement age, the coordination between your two benefits is one of the most valuable planning conversations you can have. Filing strategies that optimize for one person's benefit without considering the other can leave significant money on the table.

We'd like to review your complete picture — your benefit, your spouse's benefit if applicable, your other income sources, and your overall strategy — to make sure everything is working together as efficiently as possible.

## AGE-67 — Full Retirement Age (Born 1960+)
**Trigger**: Client turns 67 — Full Retirement Age reached (SECURE 2.0 / updated FRA schedule)
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
You've Hit Your Full Retirement Age — Let's Make Sure You're Set

### Introduction
{FirstName}, you've reached your Full Retirement Age of 67. Your Social Security benefit is now available at its full amount — no reduction for early filing, no earnings limit on what you can make while collecting. This is a planning milestone we want to make sure you're taking full advantage of.

### Value Prop
At 67, your options are clear: file now and receive 100% of your earned benefit, or continue delaying to earn an 8% annual increase through delayed retirement credits until age 70. That's a potential 24% boost over three years — guaranteed. We'll show you exactly what each scenario looks like with your numbers, factoring in your other income, your spouse's benefit, and your overall plan.

### Pain Point
The most common mistake at FRA is inertia — either filing without running the numbers, or continuing to wait without understanding the trade-off. At 67, each year of delay adds 8%, but only for three more years. The math on whether to file or wait depends on your health, your cash flow needs, your spouse's situation, and your tax picture. It's not a decision that should be made on autopilot.

Now that you've reached FRA, let's run through your full Social Security strategy and make sure it's coordinated with everything else. Call us at {Phone} or book a time at {CalendarLink}.

The right choice depends on your complete financial picture: your health, your cash flow needs, your spouse's benefit and filing strategy, your other income sources, and your tax situation. It's a decision that deserves a thorough analysis, not a quick guess.

## AGE-70 — Maximum Social Security Benefit
**Trigger**: Client turns 70 — delayed retirement credits stop, maximum SS benefit reached, file now
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
Your Social Security Benefit Is Maxed Out — Time to Lock It In

### Introduction
{FirstName}, you've reached 70 — which means your Social Security benefit has hit its maximum. Delayed retirement credits stop accruing, and there's no additional benefit to waiting even one more month. If you haven't filed yet, it's time.

### Value Prop
By waiting until 70, you've earned the highest possible Social Security benefit — up to 132% of your Full Retirement Age amount. That decision is going to pay dividends for the rest of your life, and for your spouse's life if they're eligible for a survivor benefit. Now the focus shifts: let's make sure your filing is processed, your income plan accounts for this new stream, and your overall strategy is aligned for the decades ahead.

### Pain Point
The only risk at this point is delay. Every month past 70 that you haven't filed is a month of benefits you're leaving on the table — with no additional growth to show for it. We also see clients file at 70 without coordinating with their other income sources, which can create unnecessary tax exposure. The filing itself is straightforward. The strategy around it is where the value is.

Let's get your filing squared away and make sure your income plan is set up to work with — not against — your new Social Security benefit. Call us at {Phone} or book a time at {CalendarLink}.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

You've reached age 70, and your Social Security benefit has hit its maximum. Delayed retirement credits have stopped accruing — there is no additional benefit to waiting past this point.

If you haven't filed yet, every month you wait is a month of benefits you're not receiving, with no corresponding increase to show for it.

By delaying to 70, you've secured the highest possible benefit — and that decision will pay off for the rest of your life. If your spouse is eligible for a survivor benefit, it pays off for them as well.

Now the focus shifts to execution and coordination:

- Filing your claim to start benefits as soon as possible
- Coordinating your new Social Security income with your other income sources — retirement accounts, annuities, pensions — to minimize tax exposure
- Reviewing your overall income strategy now that this piece is in place
- Confirming your Medicare and healthcare coverage is optimized alongside your income plan

This is not a complicated filing — but the strategy around how it fits into your overall picture is where the real value is.

## AGE-73 — Required Minimum Distributions Begin
**Trigger**: Client turns 73 — RMDs mandatory from traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b). Penalty: 25% of missed amount.
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
Your RMDs Start This Year — Let's Be Strategic About It

### Introduction
{FirstName}, now that you've turned 73, the IRS requires you to start taking distributions from your traditional retirement accounts — your IRA, 401(k), 403(b), and similar accounts. These are called Required Minimum Distributions, and they're not optional. The good news is that how you take them is entirely up to us to plan together.

### Value Prop
RMDs don't have to be a surprise or a stress point. With the right planning, we can determine exactly how much you're required to take, when the optimal time to take it is, which accounts to pull from, and how to minimize the tax impact. If you have multiple retirement accounts, the sequencing matters. If you have a spouse with their own accounts, the coordination matters. We turn a mandatory distribution into a strategic income event.

### Pain Point
The penalty for missing an RMD is 25% of the amount you were required to withdraw but didn't. If your first RMD year is this year, your deadline is April 1 of next year — but waiting until April means you'll have two RMDs in the same tax year, which could push you into a higher bracket. These are not consequences you want to discover after the fact. The rules are rigid. The strategy around them doesn't have to be.

### Email CTA
We need to sit down and map out your RMD strategy before the deadline. We'll calculate your required amount, identify the most tax-efficient approach, and coordinate it with your other income. Call us at {Phone} or book a time at {CalendarLink}.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

Now that you've turned 73, the IRS requires you to begin taking distributions from your traditional retirement accounts — your IRA, 401(k), 403(b), and similar tax-deferred accounts. These are called Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), and they are not optional.

Here's what you need to know:

The penalty for missing an RMD is 25% of the amount you were required to withdraw but didn't. That drops to 10% if corrected within two years — but neither scenario is one we want you in.

Your first RMD deadline is April 1 of the year after you turn 73. However, if you wait until April, you'll be taking two RMDs in the same calendar year — which could push you into a higher tax bracket unnecessarily.

The required amount is calculated based on your account balances and an IRS life expectancy table. If you have multiple retirement accounts, you have flexibility in which accounts you pull from — and that sequencing can make a meaningful difference in your tax picture.

We'd like to sit down and build your RMD strategy:

- Calculate your exact required distribution amount
- Determine the most tax-efficient timing and account sequencing
- Coordinate your RMDs with your other income sources
- Explore whether Roth conversions or other strategies make sense before or alongside your distributions

This is a mandatory event — but how you handle it is a strategic decision. Let's make sure it's planned, not reactive.

## AGE-75 — SECURE 2.0 RMD (Born 1960+)
**Trigger**: Client turns 75 — SECURE 2.0 RMD start age for those born 1960+ (future-proofing)
**Division**: WEALTH

### Subject Line
The Rules Changed — Your RMDs Don't Start Until 75

### Introduction
{FirstName}, if you were expecting Required Minimum Distributions to start at 73, here's an update in your favor: the SECURE 2.0 Act pushed your RMD start age to 75. That gives you two additional years of tax-deferred growth — and two additional years to plan strategically.

### Value Prop
Two extra years before mandatory distributions is a planning gift. It means more time for your accounts to grow tax-deferred, more runway for Roth conversion strategies if they make sense, and more flexibility in how you sequence your income in the years leading up to 75. The key is using this window intentionally — not just letting it pass.

### Pain Point
The danger with a later RMD start date is complacency. Two extra years feels like a long time — until it isn't. If you don't plan proactively, you could end up with larger account balances at 75, which means larger mandatory distributions, which means a bigger tax hit when they finally start. The window between now and 75 is a planning opportunity, not a reason to do nothing.

Hi {FirstName}, it's {AgentName} with {BOBName}. Good news — the SECURE 2.0 Act pushed your RMD start age to 75, which gives you two extra years before mandatory distributions begin. We want to make sure you're using that window to your advantage. Give me a call at {Phone} and let's talk strategy.

### USPS Piece
Dear {FirstName},

If you've been told that Required Minimum Distributions start at 73, here's an update that works in your favor: under the SECURE 2.0 Act, your RMD start age has been pushed to 75.

That means two additional years before the IRS requires you to begin taking distributions from your traditional retirement accounts. Two more years of tax-deferred growth. Two more years to plan.

Here's why that matters — and why it's not a reason to wait on planning:

The extra time gives you a window to explore strategies that could significantly reduce your lifetime tax burden. Roth conversions done strategically before RMDs begin can lower the size of your future mandatory distributions. Income sequencing — pulling from the right accounts in the right order — can keep you in a lower tax bracket during these bridge years.

But if you simply wait and do nothing, your account balances continue to grow, and when RMDs finally start at 75, the required distributions will be larger — and so will the tax bill.

The window between now and 75 is a planning opportunity. We'd like to make sure you're using it intentionally.
