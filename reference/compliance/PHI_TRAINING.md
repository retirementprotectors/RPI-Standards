## What is PHI?

**PHI = Protected Health Information**

Any information about a person's health that can identify them. If you can connect health info to a specific person, it's PHI.

### Examples of PHI We Handle

| Data Type | Example | Why It's PHI |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Medicare ID | `1EG4-TE5-MK72` | Identifies person + their Medicare enrollment |
| Health Conditions | "Client has diabetes" | Health info tied to a person |
| Medications | "Takes Metformin" | Health info tied to a person |
| Provider Info | "Sees Dr. Smith at Unity Point" | Healthcare relationship tied to a person |
| Claims History | "Had knee surgery in 2024" | Health event tied to a person |
| Plan Enrollment | "Enrolled in Wellmark MAPD" | Health coverage tied to a person |

### What's NOT PHI (by itself)

- Generic health info with no name attached ("diabetes affects 10% of Americans")
- De-identified statistics ("average client age is 72")
- Plan information without client details ("Wellmark offers Plan G")

## The Golden Rules

### 1. PHI Lives in Google Workspace ONLY

```
✅ APPROVED LOCATIONS:
   - Google Sheets (MATRIX)
   - Google Drive
   - Gmail (with precautions - see below)
   - Google Docs

❌ NEVER PUT PHI IN:
   - Personal email
   - Text messages
   - Slack (even private DMs)
   - Personal devices (unless company-managed)
   - Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive
   - Paper you take home
   - Screenshots on personal phone
```

### 2. Minimum Necessary

**Only access PHI you need for your job, nothing more.**

- Don't browse client records out of curiosity
- Don't pull up a client's health info unless you're actively working their case
- Don't share PHI with coworkers who don't need it for their role

### 3. Email PHI Carefully

**When emailing PHI (even internally):**

```
✅ DO:
   - Use your @retireprotected.com email
   - Double-check the recipient address
   - Use Google's Confidential Mode for sensitive info
   - Keep PHI in attachments rather than email body when possible

❌ DON'T:
   - Forward PHI to personal email addresses
   - CC people who don't need the information
   - Put SSN or Medicare ID in email subject lines
   - Send PHI to external parties without authorization
```

### 4. Verify Before Sharing

**Before giving PHI to anyone:**
- Is this person authorized to receive it?
- Do they need this specific information?
- Am I using a secure method to share it?

**If someone calls asking for client info:**
- Verify their identity
- Confirm they have a legitimate need
- When in doubt, call them back at a known number

### 5. Report Problems Immediately

**If you see or suspect any of these, report to JDM or John Behn immediately:**

- PHI sent to wrong person
- Unauthorized access to client records
- Lost or stolen device with PHI access
- Suspicious emails asking for client info
- Anyone accessing records they shouldn't
- PHI found in an unapproved location

**There's no penalty for reporting - we need to know so we can fix it.**

## Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Client Calls About Their Coverage
✅ **Correct:** Verify their identity, pull up their record, discuss their plan
❌ **Wrong:** Read their info to someone claiming to be their family member without verification

### Scenario 2: Coworker Asks About a Client
✅ **Correct:** "Are you working that case? Let me check if you need access."
❌ **Wrong:** Just pulling it up and reading it to them

### Scenario 3: Working From Home
✅ **Correct:** Access MATRIX through your work Google account on your secured device
❌ **Wrong:** Downloading client lists to your personal computer "just in case"

### Scenario 4: Email from a Carrier
✅ **Correct:** Reply using your @retireprotected.com email with only necessary info
❌ **Wrong:** Forwarding the whole client file when they only asked about one policy

### Scenario 5: You Accidentally Sent PHI to Wrong Person
✅ **Correct:** Report it immediately to JDM/John - we'll handle it
❌ **Wrong:** Hoping they delete it and not telling anyone
